HOW TO RUN
1. paste "$env:MASTER_KEY="super_secure_master_key" in terminal (can set as any key but must delete db or 
set database name to a new name for the key)
2. python main.py in terminal
3. can log into database with username admin and password admin for h permissions and can log in with user as 
username and user as password for r permissions (only 2 pass and usernames that works every time)


WAY TO VIEW DB FILE IN VS CODE
1. download vscode extension sqlite by alex
2. should then show up in bottom left otherwise do control shift p when on database you want to 
open and paste 'SQLite: Open Database' in the search and then it should work
3. if it works it will show in bottom left and say sqlite explorer
4. open to a table and hit left arrow to open up the db (it will open in split window)
5. once youve done step 2 and sqlite explorer shows up in bottom left you can also right click on 
your db and do open database from the menu and the database will show in bottom left explorer
